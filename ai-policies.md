# AI Policies at NIH and IC-Specific Guidance

## NIH-Wide AI Policies and Resources

### [AI Guidance - Foundational Information, Generative AI, and Risks](https://nih.sharepoint.com/sites/OD-CDATechnologyAvailabilityGuideCTAG/SitePages/AIGuidance_FoundationalInformationGenerativeAIRisks.aspx)

- Provides foundational information on AI, including definitions, key concepts, and the scope of AI technologies.
- Addresses specific risks associated with generative AI, such as data privacy concerns, potential biases, and ethical considerations.
- Offers recommendations for mitigating these risks.

### [The Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Technologies is Prohibited for the NIH Peer Review Process](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-23-149.html)

- Explicitly prohibits the use of generative AI technologies in the NIH peer review process.
- Ensures the integrity and objectivity of peer review by preventing potential biases or manipulations from AI-generated content.

### [Artificial Intelligence in Research: Policy Considerations and Guidance](https://osp.od.nih.gov/policies/artificial-intelligence/)

- A new resource issued by the Office of Science Policy (OSP) to help the research community understand how NIH policies guide AI-related research.
- Illustrates the applicability of existing policies and guidance to research involving AI technologies.

## Related Federal Policies

### [HHS: Artificial Intelligence at HHS - Statutes and Authorities](https://www.hhs.gov/programs/topic-sites/ai/statutes/index.html)

- Outlines the legal framework, statutes, and authorities governing AI use at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
- Details the relevant laws, regulations, and policies that HHS must adhere to when deploying AI technologies.

### [OPM: Responsible Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence for the Federal Workforce](https://www.opm.gov/data/resources/ai-guidance/)

- Provides guidelines for the responsible use of generative AI by the federal workforce.
- Emphasizes ethical considerations, data privacy, transparency, and accountability in developing and deploying generative AI tools within federal agencies.

## IC-Specific Guidance

While this toolkit offers general guidance on the use of generative AI, each NIH Institute and Center (IC) may have its own specific policies and guidelines. These IC-specific policies may be more restrictive or include additional requirements beyond what is outlined in this general toolkit.
