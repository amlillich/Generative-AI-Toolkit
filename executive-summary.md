# Executive Summary

The NIH Library Generative AI Usage Toolkit is a comprehensive resource designed to guide NIH staff and affiliates in the responsible and effective use of generative AI tools. This toolkit addresses the growing need for clear guidelines in AI implementation within research and administrative workflows.

Key components of the toolkit include:

1. NIH-Wide AI Policies and IC-Specific Guidance: Provides an overview of general NIH policies on AI use and emphasizes the importance of consulting and adhering to individual Institute and Center (IC) guidelines, which may have additional or more specific requirements.

2. Task Appropriateness Checklist: Helps users determine if a task is suitable for AI application.

3. AI Application Assessment Matrix: Guides the evaluation of potential AI applications, considering risk levels, boundaries, transparency, and monitoring needs.

4. AI Output Verification Methods: Outlines various approaches to verify and validate AI-generated content.

5. Documentation and Attribution Guidelines: Provides frameworks for properly documenting AI use and attributing AI-generated content.

This toolkit aims to empower NIH personnel to:

- Identify appropriate use cases for generative AI
- Implement AI tools responsibly and ethically
- Maintain high standards of accuracy and transparency
- Comply with relevant institutional policies and guidelines

By following the structured approach outlined in this toolkit, users can harness the potential of AI while upholding the rigorous standards expected in NIH's scientific and administrative processes.

## Important Note

While this toolkit provides general guidance, it does not supersede or replace policies set by individual NIH Institutes and Centers. Users must consult and follow the specific AI usage policies and guidelines of their respective IC. The toolkit should be used in conjunction with, not in place of, IC-specific guidance.
