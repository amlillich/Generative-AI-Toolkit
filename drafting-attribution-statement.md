# Drafting an Attribution Statement

Creating clear and accurate attribution statements is a key aspect of responsible AI usage. This worksheet offers a formula and examples for drafting effective attribution statements, ensuring that the use of generative AI tools is transparently communicated. Use this worksheet to craft your attribution statements, providing specific details about the AI tool, its purpose, and the extent of its contribution to your work.

## Attribution Formula

[AI tool name and version] was used to [specific task or purpose] in this [type of work]. The AI-generated content was [extent of human review/modification] by [responsible party] to ensure [desired outcome, e.g., accuracy, relevance, etc.].

## Example Attribution Statement

"ChatGPT version 3.5, an AI language model developed by OpenAI, was used by the author to assist in brainstorming ideas and generating initial drafts for sections of this report. The AI-generated content was subsequently reviewed, edited, and expanded upon by the authors to ensure accuracy and relevance to the research context."

## Additional Examples

1. For minimal use: "DALL-E 2 was used to generate the initial concept sketch for Figure 3. The image was then refined and finalized by the research team."

2. For more extensive use: "GPT-4 was employed to assist in the literature review process, helping to summarize key points from multiple sources. All AI-generated summaries were critically reviewed, fact-checked, and integrated into the final manuscript by the authors."

3. For use in data analysis: "A custom large language model, based on the GPT architecture, was used to analyze patterns in the textual data. The model's outputs were interpreted and validated by the research team, with all conclusions drawn by human experts."

## When crafting an attribution statement, consider including:

1. The specific AI tool used
2. The version or model of the AI
3. The purpose or task for which the AI was used
4. The extent of AI contribution
5. The level of human oversight and modification
6. Any limitations or potential biases of the AI tool, if relevant
