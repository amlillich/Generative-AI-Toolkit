# AI Application Assessment Matrix

Use this worksheet to identify potential applications of generative AI within your workflows and establish guidelines for responsible implementation based on the considerations outlined in the columns.

| Application | Risk Level | Boundaries | Transparency & Attribution | Monitoring |
|-------------|------------|------------|----------------------------|------------|
| Specific task or process where generative AI could be applied. | Potential risks based on data sensitivity, impact, and error potential. | Clear limits and guidelines for AI use, including human oversight requirements. | How AI use will be disclosed and if/how AI-generated content will be attributed. | Processes for overseeing AI use, including quality control and performance evaluation. |

## Example Matrix

| Application | Risk Level | Boundaries | Transparency & Attribution | Monitoring |
|-------------|------------|------------|----------------------------|------------|
| Drafting emails | Low | - Do not include confidential or personal information<br>- Review content before sending | - No need to be transparent about AI usage<br>- No attribution required | - Carefully review generated content before sending |
| Literature reviews | Medium | - Summarize key points, do not reproduce full text<br>- Verify accuracy of AI-generated insights | - Disclose use of generative AI in the process<br>- Attribute AI-generated summaries | - Review AI-assisted literature reviews for accuracy and completeness |
| Ideation and brainstorming | Low | - Use generative AI for initial idea generation only<br>- Maintain human oversight and control | - No need for transparency about AI usage<br>- No attribution required | - Ensure human review and refinement of AI-generated ideas |
| Report writing | High | - Avoid using AI to generate entire reports<br>- Limit AI to specific sections (e.g., background, data summaries) | - Clearly indicate which sections were AI-generated<br>- Attribute AI contributions accordingly | - Thoroughly review AI-assisted report sections for accuracy, completeness, and alignment with research goals |
| Data analysis | High | - Restrict AI to exploratory data analysis only<br>- Ensure human validation of findings | - Disclose use of generative AI in the analysis process<br>- Attribute any AI-generated insights or visualizations | - Implement rigorous checks and validations of AI-assisted data analysis |
